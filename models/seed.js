Due to it\'s stretch the mother plant is being held up with assistance by being tied to a stick to hoist it up. Plant tends to bow when unassisted. There still appears to be a nat problem with the plant as it may have root rot from overwatering so a moisture meter will determine when the soil is dry enough for it\'s next water cycle.",

  //   entry: Orchid has been in bloom since before April 8th 2019. It started off with two stems off blooms and it took three to four months for the blooms to start dying. When the plant was purchased the blooms were a deep blue color. I believe this is from the nursery watering it with blue color dye. About 6 months later the blooms started to come out a more magenta purple color and it grew a third stalk with new blooms only purple. Currently it  appears to be on it\'s last three blooms on it\'s second stem. Hopefully I can repot it this year if it ever stops blooming but I will not change it\'s water schedule placement or pot until then. I have only removed one leaf that was dying due to upper leaves blocking it\'s light. Appears that it is happy with lighting from florescent office to indirect lamp plant-lights,

  //   entry: Plant had originally 7 pitchers but 4 were brown before purchase. Per it\'s label I cut off the 4 brow pitchers. I read more that the plant will kill of it\'s pitchers if it is experiencing low humidity and needs more water/moisture. Also read that it prefers to be watered from the bottom. It\'s original location is in the basement where there is an oil disfuser being repurposed as a humidifer for the carnivorous plants. It has been moved upstairs where it can experience more light and sits in a water catcher plate in water so it can drink as much water as needed. Not other pitchers appear to be dying and the leaves where the pitchers were severed appear to be slowly growing pitchers. There are currently flies in the upper floors so hopefully it can catch a few so it will not need to be fertilzed in the future,
