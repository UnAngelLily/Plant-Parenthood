    entry: Plant appears to be doing well. Offsets  are in a container next to the original plant. Due to it's stretch the mother plant is being held up with assistance by being tied to a stick to hoist it up. Plant tends to bow when unassisted. There still appears to be a nat problem with the plant as it may have root rot from overwatering so a moisture meter will determine when the soil is dry enough for it\'s next water cycle. ,
