# Plant Parenthood
Website: https://git.heroku.com/livingroomsllcplantparenthood.git

The goal of the website is to provide a way to record data in regards to plant keeping. The problem I was having as a plant fanatic is that many plants have different needs in light, soil, repotting, grooming and so on. Since the plants come from many different environments and nurseries it creates the problem of constantly having to research caretaking of each plant. I have over 105 different kinds of plants so I wanted to create a track to compile caretaking information in order to organize my collect.

This website was created in order to showcase the usage of the 7 restful routes, the ability to apply partials to the css or styling of the site with a login required in order to view information while manipulating a large amount of data.

The biggest challenges was the syntax and the continuous bug hunt. Each time a new feature was added there would be a required bug hunt to see what parts were affected positively and negatively. Almost every night I requested help from the TA to double check my work and assist with a strange error.

Special thanks to Mimi, who tolerated the strangest seed bug hunt for 2 hours, provided moral support  and searched over 15 different way to figure out the issue around my seed. While the solution didn't come to me while we were searching together I somehow managed to narrow into a solution.

Future features and unresolved issues include, adding a carousel to the entries for it to be functional for recording keeping, and the "seed" link in the header. I originally wanted to add a carousel and a second model in order to have a function to enter and then click through multiple entries. I also wanted the seed button to automatically populate the seed in my database. 


THINGS TO CHANGE AND ADD!
The add button stopped working on the heroku app so look at the button. Check out why that stopped working.
Adding a carosuel to the plant entries.
More user functionality to make sure multiple people can use it without deleting and editing other's stuff.
More messages for error and models .
Add artist credit for the graphic.
Way to add photos without having to link and upload it onto imgur?
